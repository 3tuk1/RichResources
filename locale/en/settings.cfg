[mod-setting-description]
rich-resources-multiplier=Sets the multiplier for all resource richness.\nAffects newly generated chunks.
richresources-apply-to-existing-ores=If enabled, the mod will also apply changes to already discovered ore patches.
richresources-reset-processed-list=If enabled, clears the list of ores processed by this mod.\n[color=red]If turned on, the multiplier will be applied again to all current ores.]\n*Must have 'Apply to existing ore patches' enabled for this to work.[/color]\nIt will automatically turn off after processing.
rich-resources-infinite-min-base=If an infinite resource (Oil etc.) has amount less than this value, this amount is used as base before multiplication.\nUsed to ensure depleted oil wells can be restored with a reasonable yield. Default: 30000 (10%)
rich-resources-maintenance-multiplier=Sets the multiplier to apply ONLY to resources that have already been processed by this mod.
richresources-apply-maintenance=If enabled, applies the "Maintenance Multiplier" to already processed resources.\n[color=yellow]Unprocessed resources are ignored.[/color]\nIt will automatically turn off after processing.
richresources-enable-distance-bonus=If enabled, adds extra multiplier based on the distance from the starting location (0,0).\nFormula: Final Multiplier = Base Multiplier * (1 + (Distance / Interval) * Rate)
richresources-distance-interval=The interval distance (in tiles) for calculation. Default: 1000
richresources-distance-rate=The bonus rate added per interval.\nExample: 0.5 means +50% increase to the final multiplier per interval.
